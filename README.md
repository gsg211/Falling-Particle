# Falling-Particle Simulation

This project is a **Falling Particle Simulation** built using **Java** and the **Processing library**. It simulates the behavior of particles falling under gravity and includes interactive mechanics inspired by real-world chemistry reactions and physics.

### Features:
- **Falling Particles**: Simulate the movement of particles influenced by gravity.
- **Reaction Mechanic**: Inspired by chemistry, materials interact with each other in a reactive way when they come into contact.
- **Fluids**: Fluid dynamics are implemented, allowing certain materials to flow and interact like liquids. These materials spread and settle in their surroundings based on their properties.
- **Fire**: The simulation includes a fire mechanic where certain materials can ignite and burn when they come into contact with fire.
